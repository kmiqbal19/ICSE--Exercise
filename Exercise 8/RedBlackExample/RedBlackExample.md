Solution
1. Red-Black Tree:
A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree. It maintains balance through the use of colors on its nodes (red or black) and satisfies the following properties:

- Every node is either red or black.
- The root is always black.
- Every leaf (NIL) is black.
- If a node is red, both its children are black.
- Every simple path from a node to its descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes.
2. Insertion into Red-Black Tree:
Insert the sequence [6,7,3,4,2,1] into a red-black tree:

Initial state: 6(B)
Insert 7:      
    6(B)
       \
      7(R)
Insert 3:
     6(B)
    /   \
  3(R)  7(R)
Insert 4:
     6(B)
    /   \
  3(R)  7(R)
     \
    4(R)
Insert 2:
     4(B)
    /   \
  3(R)  6(R)
 /       \
2(R)       7(B)

Insert 1:
        4(B)
       /   \
     2(R)  6(R)
    / \     \
  1(R) 3(B)  7(B)

3. Red-red violations occur when there are consecutive red nodes along a path. In such cases, rotations and color flips are performed to restore the balance. After fixing red-red violations, the final tree is as shown in the previous step.
4. For the same sequence [6,7,3,4,2,1], the AVL tree would be:
   4
  / \
 2   6
/ \   \
1  3   7
Compared to the red-black tree, AVL trees have stricter balancing requirements, and rotations are performed to maintain balance.
5.  2-3-4 Trees and Red-Black Trees:
- In a 2-3-4 tree, a node can have 2, 3, or 4 children, corresponding to red nodes in a red-black tree.
- A 2-node in a 2-3-4 tree corresponds to a black node in a red-black tree.
- A 3-node in a 2-3-4 tree corresponds to a red node with a black child in a red-black tree.
- A 4-node in a 2-3-4 tree corresponds to a red node with two black children in a red-black tree.

6. Transform Red-Black Tree to 2-3-4 Tree:


Original Red-Black Tree:
        4(B)
       /   \
     2(R)  6(R)
    / \     \
  1(R) 3(B)  7(B)

Step 1: Convert 4-node to 3-nodes
        (2,4)(B)
       /       \
     2(R)      6(R)
    / \        / \
  1(R) 3(B)   5(B) 7(B)
Step 2: Convert 3-nodes to 2-nodes
       (2,4)(B)
       /    \
     2(1,3)   6(5,7)(R)
Step 3: Adjust the root
        4(2)
       /    \
     2(1,3)   6(5,7)(R)


Final 2-3-4 tree: 
          4
       /      \
     2        6
   /   \     /   \
  1   3     5    7
