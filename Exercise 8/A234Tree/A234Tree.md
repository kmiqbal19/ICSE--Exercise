Solution

A 2-3-4 tree is a type of search tree in which each internal node can have 2, 3, or 4 children. These nodes are designed to contain a variable number of keys (values), and the tree is balanced in such a way that all leaf nodes are at the same level. The tree is used for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.

In a 2-3-4 tree, nodes can be of three types:

1. 2-node: Contains one key and two child nodes.
2. 3-node: Contains two keys and three child nodes.
3. 4-node: Contains three keys and four child nodes.
Here's how the insertion process works in a 2-3-4 tree:

1. Start with an empty tree.
2. Insert the key into the appropriate node.
3. If the node becomes a 4-node, split it by promoting the middle key to the parent.
4. Continue splitting and promoting keys up the tree if necessary.

Now, let's insert the numbers 3, 7, 5, 15, 17, 9, 13, 21, 11, and 19 into a 2-3-4 tree, first in the given order and then in a different order.
Insert 3:
[3]

Insert 7:
[3, 7]

Insert 5:
[3, 5, 7]

Insert 15:
[3, 5, 7, 15]

Insert 17:
[3, 5, 7, 15, 17]

Split root and promote 15:
    [15]
    /  \
[3,5,7] [17]

Insert 9:
    [15]
    /  \
[3,5,7] [9,17]

Insert 13:
       [15]
    /    \      \
[3,5,7] [9,13] [17]

Insert 21:
       [15]
    /    \      \
[3,5,7] [9,13] [17,21]

Split root and promote 17:

        [15, 17]
        /   |   \
[3, 5, 7] [9, 13] [21]


Insert 11:

        [15, 17]
        /   |   \
[3, 5, 7] [9, 11, 13] [21]


Insert 19:

        [15, 17]
        /   |   \
[3, 5, 7] [9, 11, 13] [19, 21]


The final 2-3-4 tree is balanced.



### Insert in the order 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21:

Insert 3:
[3]

Insert 5:
[3, 5]

Insert 7:
[3, 5, 7]

Insert 9:
[3, 5, 7, 9]

Insert 11:
[3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

Split root and promote 7:
    [7]
    /
[3, 5] [9, 11]

Insert 13:
    [7]
    /
[3, 5] [9, 11, 13]

Insert 15:
    [7, 13]
    /   |
[3, 5] [9, 11] [15]

Insert 17:
    [7, 13]
    /   |
[3, 5] [9, 11] [15, 17]

Insert 19:
        [7, 13]
     /  |       \
[3, 5] [9, 11] [15, 17, 19]

Insert 21:
     [13]
     / | \
[7] [15, 17] [21]
/ \
[9, 11]

The final 2-3-4 tree is balanced in this order as well. The order of insertion affects the structure of the tree, but the balancing properties ensure that the tree remains balanced regardless of the insertion order.
