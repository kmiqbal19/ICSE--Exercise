Solution

## AVL Tree:
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, named after its inventors Adelson-Velsky and Landis. The primary goal of AVL trees is to maintain balance during insertion and deletion operations to ensure that the tree remains relatively balanced. Balance is crucial because it helps maintain efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. Unbalanced trees, on the other hand, can degrade into essentially linear data structures, losing the logarithmic time complexity advantage of search operations that is characteristic of balanced binary search trees.

The balance in an AVL tree is maintained by ensuring that the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. If at any time during an insertion or deletion operation, the balance factor of a node becomes greater than 1 or less than -1, the tree needs to be rebalanced.

The balance factor of a node is calculated as the difference between the height of its left subtree and the height of its right subtree. Mathematically, for a node with height h, the balance factor BF is given by:

BF = height(left subtree) âˆ’ height(right subtree)

The AVL tree insertion algorithm ensures that after each insertion, the balance factors along the path from the inserted node to the root are updated, and if necessary, rotations are performed to restore balance.


Let's go through the AVL tree insertion algorithm for the given sequence: 14, 17, 19, 7, 5, 10, 18.

Insert 14:

Tree: 14

Insert 17:
Tree:     
  14
    \
    17
Insert 19: 
Tree: 
   14
    \
    17
      \
      19
At this point, the balance factor of node 14 is 2, violating the AVL property.
Perform a left rotation on node 14:
Tree: 
    17
   /  \
  14   19
Insert 7:

Tree:
    17
   /  \
  14   19
 /
7
Insert 5:

Tree:
      17
     /  \
   14   19
 / \
7   18
/
5
Insert 10:

Tree:
      17
     /  \
    14   19
   / \
  7   18
 / \
5  10
The final AVL tree is balanced, and the balance factors along the path from the inserted nodes to the root are within the acceptable range [-1, 1]. The rotations performed ensure that the tree maintains its balance after each insertion.
